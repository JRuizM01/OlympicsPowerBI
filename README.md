# PowerBI Olympics dataset Dashboard & Analytics
The dataset contains detailed information about 45,364 distinct athletes who participated in the Olympic Games, both Summer and Winter, from Sydney 2000 to Rio de Janeiro 2016. Each athlete is represented in multiple rows, as the dataset records each athlete's event during specific Olympic Games.

For each athlete, the dataset includes demographic information such as gender, weight, height, and the country they represent. Additionally, it captures performance data, including the sport and specific event they competed in, along with any medals they received.

As you can see, there are more than 85,000 rows (for 45.3k athletes only), this is because the grain of the dataset is the following: each row corresponds to a single event in which an athlete participated during a particular Olympic Games.
